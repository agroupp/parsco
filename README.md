# Parsco

**Parsco** is a TypeScript library for building powerful, composable parsers using the parser combinator pattern. It provides a set of small, reusable parsing tools that can be combined to create complex grammars and interpreters, all without the need for separate tokenization or external parser generators.

## Run tasks

To build the library use:

```sh
npx nx build parsco
```
